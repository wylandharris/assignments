How well does your brute force decryptor work?
	My brute force works, but it there is not a dictionary to find the decrypt on its own. That means that the user has to find the right one.
What are its advantages? Disadvantages?
	The advantages for mine is that it cannot mess up because it simply prints the possibilites
	The disadvantes for it were that it did not include the dictionary to choose the correct shift.
