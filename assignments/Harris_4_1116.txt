1) What is PGP?
	PGP is pretty good privacy, a type of encryption used in emails.
2) What is PGP used for?
	When they receiver receives it, they decrypt it using their own 
	private key. Since encrypting an entire message can take a long time, 
	PGP uses a faster encryption algorithm to encrypt the message and then 
	uses the public key to encrypt the shorter key that was used to encrypt 
	the entire message.
3) How do public keys and private keys work?
	A private key can decrypt a public key and a public key can decrypt a 
	private key. So for it to work, someone must encrypt their file with
	the other persons public key and send it to rhe second person who has 
	their private key.
4) What does RSA stand for? Why?
	Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, these are the inventors of RSA.
5) What is the web of trust? Why is it important?
	In cryptography, a web of trust is a concept used in PGP, GnuPG, and 
	other OpenPGP-compatible systems to establish the authenticity of the 
	binding between a public key and its owner.
6)What is OpenPGP? Why is it important?
	It is a standard that defines formats for encryption keys and messages. 
	PGP is a trademarked term used by Symantec Corporation for their 
	OpenPGP-compliant products, such as Symantec PGP Command Line.
